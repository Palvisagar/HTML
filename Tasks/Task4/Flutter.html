        What is Flutter?
        In general, creating a mobile application is a very complex and challenging task. 
        There are many frameworks available, which provide excellent features to develop mobile applications. 
        For developing mobile apps, Android provides a native framework based on Java and Kotlin language, while iOS provides a framework based on Objective-C/Swift language. 
        Thus, we need two different languages and frameworks to develop applications for both OS. 
        Today, to overcome form this complexity, there are several frameworks have introduced that support both OS along with desktop apps. 
        These types of the framework are known as cross-platform development tools.
        The cross-platform development framework has the ability to write one code and can deploy on the various platform (Android, iOS, and Desktop). 
        It saves a lot of time and development efforts of developers. There are several tools available for cross-platform development, 
        including web-based tools, such as Ionic from Drifty Co. in 2013, Phonegap from Adobe, Xamarin from Microsoft, and React Native form Facebook. 
        Each of these frameworks has varying degrees of success in the mobile industry. In recent, a new framework has introduced in the cross-platform development family named Flutter developed from Google.
